# Hangman

## Summary

This is a web based game of Hangman that uses JavaScript and includes arrays, iterators, DOM manipulation, event listeners and string manipulation.

## Instructions

- The game starts with a word being randomly selected.
- A representation of the word made up of underscore (\_) characters displays on the screen.
- The user interface has buttons representing all 26 letters of the alphabet and clicking a button should registers its letter as a 'guess'.
- If the letter clicked is in the word each underscore corresponding to that letter will be replaced with the letter.
- If the letter is not in the word, an additional element to the hangman diagram will be added.
- The game keeps track of which letters have been 'guessed' already.
- The user has a maximum of 10 guesses before losing.
- At the end the user has the possibility to play again.
